## Overview

Modern digital payments generate huge transaction volumes and are attractive targets for fraudsters. Banks and fintechs need systems that can:

- Detect suspicious activity in real time  
- Adapt to complex, non-linear patterns  
- Provide decisions that can be plugged into existing workflows  

This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of such a system:

1. Data preprocessing and model training on a real credit card fraud dataset  
2. Evaluation using appropriate metrics for imbalanced data  
3. Serialization of the trained model  
4. Deployment as a web application for real-time scoring
