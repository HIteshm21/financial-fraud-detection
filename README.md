🎯 Financial Transaction Fraud Detection System

🚀 Real-Time Fraud Prediction | Machine Learning | Streamlit Deployment

📌 Overview

Modern digital payment systems generate huge numbers of transactions every second.
To ensure customer safety and reduce financial losses, fraud detection systems must:

🔍 Detect suspicious patterns in real time
⚡ Operate efficiently on highly imbalanced datasets
🧠 Adapt to complex, non-linear transaction behaviours
🔗 Integrate easily with existing financial workflows

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end fraud prediction pipeline — from data preprocessing to model deployment — using a real credit card fraud dataset.

🧠 Key Features

✨ Real-time fraud prediction via Streamlit UI
✨ Advanced ML model (Random Forest) trained on imbalanced data
✨ Model evaluation including Accuracy, Recall, F1-Score & ROC-AUC
✨ User-friendly interactive web app
✨ Clean modular structure (data → model → deployment)
✨ Fully deployed online for demo access
